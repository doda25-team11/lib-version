# Versioning for stable releases

When released on the main branch, convert the snapshot to stable and bump it to the next patch of snapshot.

# Versioning for the pre-releases

Make a format for separate feature pre-release naming, like `app-1.2.3-new-feature-251112-124753 .` and this naming should be generating when releasing on other branches than main.
